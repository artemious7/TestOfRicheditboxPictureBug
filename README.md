# TestOfRicheditboxPictureBug
In Windows 10 1703 Creators Update a new bug appeared.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load an RTF document with a picture into RichEditBox
2. Save it.
3. Save it again.
4. Reload it or open it with another app - you will see that the picture is gone and all the content after it is gone too.

This project is to demonstrate the bug and to fix it.
